# Prism4j

Simplified Java clone of [prism-js](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism). No rendering, no themes,
no hooks, no plugins. But still _a_ language parsing. Primary aim of this library is to provide a _tokenization_ strategy of arbitrary syntaxes for later processing. Works on Android (great with [Markwon](https://github.com/noties/Markwon) - markdown display library). 

## Core

Core module `prism4j` is a lightweight module that comes with API (no language definitions).

[![prism4j](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.noties/prism4j.svg?label=prism4j)](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22io.noties%22%20AND%20a%3A%22prism4j%22)

```kotlin
implementation "io.noties:prism4j:${prism_version}"
```

```java
final Prism4j prism4j = new Prism4j(new MyGrammarLocator());
final Grammar grammar = prism4j.grammar("json");
if (grammar != null) {
    final List<Node> nodes = prism4j.tokenize(code, grammar);
    final AbsVisitor visitor = new AbsVisitor() {
            @Override
            protected void visitText(@NonNull Prism4j.Text text) {
                // raw text
                text.literal();
            }

            @Override
            protected void visitSyntax(@NonNull Prism4j.Syntax syntax) {
                // type of the syntax token
                syntax.type();
                visit(syntax.children());
            }
        };
    visitor.visit(nodes);
}
```

Where `MyGrammarLocator` can be as simple as:

```java
public class MyGrammarLocator implements GrammarLocator {

    @Nullable
    @Override
    public Prism4j.Grammar grammar(@NonNull Prism4j prism4j, @NonNull String language) {
        switch (language) {

            case "json":
                return Prism_json.create(prism4j);

            // everything else is omitted

            default:
                return null;
        }
    }
}
```

And language definition:

```java
import static java.util.regex.Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE;
import static java.util.regex.Pattern.compile;
import static io.noties.prism4j.Prism4j.grammar;
import static io.noties.prism4j.Prism4j.pattern;
import static io.noties.prism4j.Prism4j.token;

@Aliases("jsonp")
public class Prism_json {

  @NonNull
  public static Prism4j.Grammar create(@NonNull Prism4j prism4j) {
    return grammar(
      "json",
      token("property", pattern(compile("\"(?:\\\\.|[^\\\\\"\\r\\n])*\"(?=\\s*:)", CASE_INSENSITIVE))),
      token("string", pattern(compile("\"(?:\\\\.|[^\\\\\"\\r\\n])*\"(?!\\s*:)"), false, true)),
      token("number", pattern(compile("\\b0x[\\dA-Fa-f]+\\b|(?:\\b\\d+\\.?\\d*|\\B\\.\\d+)(?:[Ee][+-]?\\d+)?"))),
      token("punctuation", pattern(compile("[{}\\[\\]);,]"))),
      token("operator", pattern(compile(":"))),
      token("boolean", pattern(compile("\\b(?:true|false)\\b", CASE_INSENSITIVE))),
      token("null", pattern(compile("\\bnull\\b", CASE_INSENSITIVE)))
    );
  }
}
```

## Bundler

In order to simplify adding language definitions to your project there is a special module
called `prism4j-bundler` that will automatically add requested languages.

[![prism4j-bundler](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.noties/prism4j-bundler.svg?label=prism4j-bundler)](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|g%3A%22io.noties%22%20AND%20a%3A%22prism4j-bundler%22)

```kotlin
annotationProcessor 'io.noties:prism4j-bundler:${prism_version}'
```

Please note that `bundler` can add languages that are _ported_ (see `./languages` folder for the list).
Currently it supports:
* `brainf*ck`
* `c`
* `clike`
* `clojure`
* `cpp`
* `csharp` (`dotnet`)
* `css` (+`css-extras`)
* `dart`
* `git`
* `go`
* `groovy` (no string interpolation)
* `java`
* `javascript` (`js`)
* `json` (`jsonp`)
* `kotlin`
* `latex`
* `makefile`
* `markdown`
* `markup` (`xml`, `html`, `mathml`, `svg`)
* `python`
* `scala`
* `sql`
* `swift`
* `yaml`

Please see `Contributing` section if you wish to port a language.

```java
@PrismBundle(
    includes = { "clike", "java", "c" },
    grammarLocatorClassName = ".MyGrammarLocator"
)
public class MyClass {}
```

You can have multiple language bundles, just annotate different classes in your project. There are
no special requirements for a class to be annotated (in can be any class in your project).

* `includes` - indicates what supported languages to add to your project. Please use _real_
language name (not an alias). So `javascript` instead of `js`; `markup` instead of `xml`.

* `grammarLocatorClassName` - is the Java class name of generated `GrammarLocator`. It can start with a `dot` to
 put generated `GrammarLocator` to the same package as annotated element. Or be fully qualified Java name (starting with a package).

### !important
**NB** generated `GrammarLocator` will create languages when they are requested (aka _lazy_ loading). Make sure this works for you by keeping as is or by manually triggering language creation via `prism4j.grammar("my-language");` when convenient at runtime.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project porting grammar definitions would be the best start.
But before you begin please create an issue with `language-support` tag so others can see that
a language is being worked at. This issue will be also the great place to discuss things that
could arise whilst in process.

Language definitions are at the `/languages` folder (go down the `io.noties.prism4j.languages`
package to find the files). A new file should follow simple naming convention:
`Prism_{real_language_name}.java`. So, a definition for the `json` would be `Prism_json.java`.

In order to provide `bundler` with meta-information about a language `@Aliases`, `@Extend`
and `@Modify` annotations can be used:

* `@Aliases` specifies what aliases a language has. For example `markup` language has
these: `@Aliases({"html", "xml", "mathml", "svg"})`. So when a `GrammarLocator` will be
asked for a `svg` language the `markup` will be returned.
```java
@Aliases({"html", "xml", "mathml", "svg"})
public class Prism_markup {}
```

* `@Extend` annotation indicates if a language definition is a sibling of another one.
So even if a parent language is not included in `@PrismBundle` it will be added to a project
anyway. For example, `c`:

```java
@Extend("clike")
public class Prism_c {}
```

* `@Modify` annotation makes sure that if a language definition modifies another one,
modified language will be processed before returning to a caller. This does not include a
language that is being modified to a project. But if it's present, it will be modified.
For example, `css`:

```java
@Modify("markup")
public class Prism_css {}
```

`@Modify` accepts an array of language names

---

After you are done (haha!) with a language definition please make sure that you also move
test cases from [prism-js](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism) for the project (for newly added
language of cause). Thankfully just a byte of work required here as `prism4j-languages` module
understands native format of _prism-js_ test cases (that are ending with `*.test`).
Please inspect test folder of the `prism4j-languages` module for further info. In short: copy test cases from `prism-js` project (the whole folder for specific language) into `prism4j-languages/src/test/resources/languages/` folder. 

Then, if you run:
```bash
./gradlew :prism4j-test:test
```

and all tests pass (including your newly added), then it's _safe_ to issue a pull request. **Good job!**

### Important note about regex for contributors

As this project _wants_ to work on Android, your regex's patterns must have `}` symbol escaped (`\\}`). Yes, _an_ IDE will warn you that this escape is not needed, but do not believe it. Pattern just won't compile at runtime (Android). I wish this could be unit-**tested** but unfortunately Robolectric compiles just fine (no surprise actually).
